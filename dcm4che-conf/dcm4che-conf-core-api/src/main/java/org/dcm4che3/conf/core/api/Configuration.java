/**
 * Denotes a configuration source. Can be used by BeanVitalizer that creates POJOs, or configuration administration app that provides UI to edit configuration.
 * <br/> <br/>
 * The Configuration API operates on a tree data structure, where any subtree is referred to as a configuration node.
 * A configuration node represents a JSON object. A configuration node is either
 * <ul>
 * <li> a primitive wrapper/string (Number, Boolean, String)</li>
 * <li> null</li>
 * <li> a collection of nodes </li>
 * <li> Map&lt;String,Object&gt; where each object is a configuration node (single map can have values of multiple types.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Formally, if such a node object is serialized into JSON and back without any transformations applied, the resulting object should be deep-equal to the original one.
 * <p/>
 * A <i>path</i> is a valid XPath expression evaluated against the configuration tree. The usage of very advanced XPath expressions is not recommended, since it could lead to eager loading of configuration tree.
 * Examples of paths can be found in org.dcm4che3.conf.dicom.DicomPath. A helper class org.dcm4che3.conf.core.util.PathPattern can be used to safely compose parametrized paths.

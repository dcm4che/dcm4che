description=\n\
The DICOM generation tool provides a way to generate DICOM files. \
The generated files depends on the specified DICOM file.\
Typically UIDs would be randomly generated, however override attributes\
can be specified using the --override option which can include study UIDs.\
SeriesInstanceUIDs and SopInstanceUIDs are randomly generated.\
Default output directory is current directory.\n\-\n\
Options:
example=Examples:\n\
$ dcmgen --override StudyInstanceUID=1.2.3 10 2 seedFile.dcm\n\
Creates a study with uid 1.2.3 2 series each holding 5 \
instances with uids randomly generated and output directory \
is current directory. \n\
$ dcmgen 10 seedFile.dcm /tmp \n\
Creates a study with a randomly generated uid with 1 series \
holding 10 instances and output directory is current directory.

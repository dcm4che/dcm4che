description=\n\
The ianscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the Instance \
Available Notification (IAN) SOP Class and for the Verification SOP Class. \
DICOM files specified on the command line may contain IAN or Composite Objects. \
Files with filename extension '.xml' are parsed as XML Infoset of the native \
DICOM Model specified in DICOM Part 19. Specified IAN objects are sent verbatim \
by one IAN N-CREATE to a Service Class Provider (SCP) of the IAN SOP Class. For \
Composite Objects for each different Study an IAN N-CREATE referencing the SOP \
Instances in the scanned files is sent to a Service Class Provider (SCP) of the \
IAN SOP Class. If no DICOM file is specified, it sends a DICOM C-ECHO message \
and waits for a response.\n\-\n\

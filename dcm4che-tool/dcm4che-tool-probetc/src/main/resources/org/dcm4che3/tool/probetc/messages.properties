description=\n\
Reads transfer capabilities from specified source AE in the config backend and displays the accepted \
transfer capabilities by the probed AE to the console, can also set the accepted \
transfer capabilities to destination AE using ldap configuration or java preferences \
Uses a source AE to acquire the transfer capabilities from the provided configuration backend\
Possible use case is to clone a remote AE transfer capabilities to another AE in your configuration backend\
possibly providing a source AETitle that contains the super set of transfer capabilities supported.

Example: probetc -b TOOLAET --ldap ldap.properties -c DCM4CHEE@0.0.0.0:11112 \n\
=>Uses the TCFile containing all TCs defined by DICOM, probes DCM4CHEE for TCs accepted using the AETitle TOOLAET and sets the transfer \n\
capability configuration for DCM4CHEE on ldap using the provided ldap.properties to connect to the ldap server (see sample ldap.properties).
Example: probetc -b TOOLAET -prefs -s DCM4CHEE -c STORESCP@0.0.0.0:11112 -d STORESCP2 \n\
=>Uses the TCs from DCM4CHEE, probes STORESCP for accepted TCs using the TOOLAETs and sets the transfer capability configuration for STORESCP2\n\
on local prefs.

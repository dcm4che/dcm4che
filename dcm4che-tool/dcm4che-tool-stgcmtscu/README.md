    The stgcmtscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the
    Storage Commitment Push Model SOP Class. DICOM files specified on the
    command line are scanned and one or several Storage Commitment Requests
    (N-ACTION RQ) for the SOP Instances in the scanned files are sent to a
    Service Class Provider (SCP) of the Storage Commitment Push Model SOP
    Class. If no DICOM file is specified, it sends a DICOM C-ECHO message and
    waits for a response.

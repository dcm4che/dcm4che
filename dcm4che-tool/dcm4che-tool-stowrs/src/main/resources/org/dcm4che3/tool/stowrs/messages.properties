For DICOM files : Send multiple dicom files or directories containing DICOM files to STOW-RS receiver at a time. \n\
For metadata+bulkdata : Send multiple bulkdata files or directories containing bulkdata files to STOW-RS receiver at a time. \
DICOM attributes can be specified via command line (using -m option) or a XML file (using -f option) \
If both the options are specified, system will generate metadata first from sample metadata file then from \
file specified by user and lastly add the attributes specified individually on command line. The Type 1 and Type 2 attributes, \
if missing, will be generated by the system. Storing bulkdata files of various Content types in one request is not possible \
i.e for eg. one can send multiple pdfs in one request, but can not send combination of files like pdfs and images in one request. \
Supported content types for bulkdata are application/pdf, text/xml (for CDA files), image/jpeg, video/mpeg, video/mp4, \
video/quicktime, image/jp2, image/png, image/gif, application/sla (for STL files), model/mtl (for MTL files) and model/obj (for OBJ files). \n\
For metadata : Send single non bulkdata type of file by specifying a metadata file for objects like Structured Reports, \
Presentation States etc. \n\
File names shall not contain spaces. \n\-\n\
Options:
example=-\n\
Example: stowrs -m PatientName=John^Doe --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies img.jpeg \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the attribute given and img.jpeg bulkData.\n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyInstanceUID} object1.dcm object2.dcm \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the given dicom files to the specified study.\n\-\n\
Example: stowrs -f sr-metadata.xml --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyInstanceUID} \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the given metadata xml file for a Structured Report to the specified study.\n\-\n\
Example: stowrs --contentType model/stl --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies/{StudyInstanceUID} file.stl \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver for specified STL file to the specified study. Additionally content type of the \n\
file returned by system will be ignored and instead specified content type shall be considered in multipart request. \n\-\n\
Example: stowrs -t json -m StudyInstanceUID=1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10 --url http[s]://<host>:<port>/dcm4chee-arc/aets/{AETitle}/rs/studies file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver first generating metadata from etc/stowrs/encapsulatedPDFMetadata.xml and then adding \n\
given StudyInstanceUID for the 3 pdf files. \n\ 
accept=Specify the value for Accept header : xml or json. \
The value of Accept header will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
For DICOM objects, if this option is not set then application/dicom+xml will be used always by default. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects the value specified in -t option will be used to determine application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If -t option is absent as well then application/dicom+xml will be used by default. 
bearer=Specify the bearer token to be used in Authorization header for server authentication. 
contentType=Specify MIME type of bulkdata file(s). If specified, content type of individual bulkdata file(s) \
(and/or in directory(-ies)) shall not be probed.
file=Specify the file containing the metadata (in XML format).
metadata=Specify metadata attributes. attr can be specified by keyword or tag value \
(in hex), e.g. PatientName or 00100010. Attributes in nested Datasets can be \
specified by including the keyword/tag value of the sequence attribute, \
e.g. 00400275.00400009 for Scheduled Procedure Step ID in the Request.
no-app=Application segments APPn are to be excluded from JPEG stream. If absent JPEG stream verbatim encapsulated by default.
pixel-header=If this option is specified, then the metadata information shall be extracted from header of pixel data \
for jpeg images, mpeg, mp4 and quicktime videos in addition to the metadata generation as explained above in description.
tsuid=Specify if the Transfer Syntax UID shall be sent in multipart request for content types image/jpeg, \
video/mpeg, video/mp4 or video/quicktime files.
type=Specify the value for Content-type header : xml or json. \
The value of Content-type will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects application/dicom+xml will be used by default. \
Note that for DICOM objects, tool will always send Content-type as application/dicom.
url=Specify the request URL.
user=Specify the user name and password to use for server authentication.
video=Send gif file as Video Photographic Image Storage by generating sample metadata from etc/stowrs/vlPhotographicImageMetadata.xml file.
xc=Send image files as VL Photographic images by generating sample metadata from etc/stowrs/vlPhotographicImageMetadata.xml file.
bulkdata-file-not-supported=File content type {0} not supported.
ignore-non-matching-file-content-type=Ignoring file {0} as content type {1} does not match with specified or previously \
computed content type value {2}.
not-dicom-file=Ignoring non DICOM file {0}
supplement-metadata-from-file=Supplementing file {0} specific metadata.
allowAnyHost=If the other server requires HTTPS and this option is specified, the other server’s certificate is validated \
via the truststore, but host name validation is not done.
disableTM=If the other server requires HTTPS and this option is specified, a truststore need not be specified.
encapsulatedDocLength=If specified, supplement Encapsulated Document Length (0042,0015) attribute in metadata for \
encapsulated document uploads.
limit=If specified, split number of objects sent in one request. More objects than the specified limit are sent split \
in multiple HTTP requests sequentially over one TCP connection.
tmp-file-dir=directory were temporary file with File Meta Information from scanned files is stored; \
if not specified, the file is stored into the default temporary-file directory
tmp-file-prefix=prefix for generated file name for temporary file; 'stowrs-' by default
tmp-file-suffix=suffix for generated file name for temporary file; '.tmp' by default
scanning=Scanning files to send
scanned=Scanned {0} files in {1}s (={2}ms/file)
connected=Connected to {0} in {1}ms
sent=Sent {0} objects (={1}MB) in {2}s (={3}MB/s) in this http request
sentAll=Sent overall {0} objects (={1}MB) in {2}s (={3}MB/s) in one TCP connection

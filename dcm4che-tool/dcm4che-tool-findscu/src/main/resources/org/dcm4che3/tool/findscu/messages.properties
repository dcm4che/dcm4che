description=\n\
The findscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the \
Query/Retrieve, the Modality Worklist Management, the Unified Worklist and \
Procedure Step, the Hanging Protocol Query/Retrieve and the Color Palette \
Query/Retrieve Service Class. findscu only supports query functionality using \
the C-FIND message. It sends query keys to an Service Class Provider (SCP) \
and waits for responses. Query keys can be specified in DICOM binary file(s) \
dcmfile_in or xml file(s) dcmfile_in.xml or by options -m and -r. \
For reference, sample files (patient.xml, study.xml, series.xml, instance.xml, mwl.xml) \
with query keys on PATIENT, STUDY, SERIES, IMAGE and MWL levels \
are provided in etc/findscu folder. \n\-\n\

Example 1: findscu -c DCMQRSCP@localhost:11112 -m PatientName=Doe^John -m StudyDate=20110510- \
-m ModalitiesInStudy=CT\n\
=> Query Query/Retrieve Service Class Provider DCMQRSCP listening on local port 11112 for CT Studies \
for Patient John Doe since 2011-05-10 \n\-\n\
Example 2: findscu -c DCMQRSCP@localhost:11112 /etc/findscu/study.xml \n\
=> Query Query/Retrieve Service Class Provider DCMQRSCP listening on local port 11112 with query keys \
provided in /etc/findscu/study.xml file
model=specifies Information Model. Supported names: PatientRoot, StudyRoot, PatientStudyOnly, \
MWL, UPSPull, UPSWatch, HangingProtocol or ColorPalette. If no Information Model is specified, \
StudyRoot will be used.
invalid-model-name={0} is not a supported Information Model name
model-uid=specifies additional Information Model by UID. Can be used for private Find SOP Classes. \
This will add additional presentation context to the association request.\
Format: cuid[|TS[|TS[..]]] where TS are additional Transfer Syntax UIDs in separated Presentation Context.
level=specifies retrieve level. Use STUDY for PatientRoot, StudyRoot, PatientStudyOnly by default.
match=specify matching key. attr can be specified by keyword or tag value \
(in hex), e.g. PatientName or 00100010. Attributes in nested Datasets can be \
specified by including the keyword/tag value of the sequence attribute, \
e.g. 00400275/00400009 for Scheduled Procedure Step ID in the Request \
Attributes Sequence. Overrides query keys specified in DICOM query file(s). 
return=specify return key. key can be specified by keyword or tag value \
(in hex), e.g. NumberOfStudyRelatedSeries or 00201206. Overrides query keys \
specified in DICOM query file(s)
cancel=cancel the query request after the receive of the specified number of \
matches.
out-dir=specifies directory where attributes of received matches are stored \
into DICOM files with file names specified by option --out-file.
out-file=specifies name of DICOM files with received matches written to the directory specified \

out-cat=concatenate received matches into one file
xml=write received matches as XML Infoset specified in DICOM Part 19
xsl=apply specified XSLT stylesheet to XML representation of received matches; implies -X
indent=use additional whitespace in XML output
no-keyword=do not include keyword attribute of DicomAttribute element in XML output
xmlns=include xmlns='http://dicom.nema.org/PS3.19/models/NativeDICOM' attribute in root element
in-attr=specifies which attribute(s) of given DICOM file(s) dcmfile_in will be included in the \
C-FIND RQ. attr can be specified by its keyword or tag value (in hex), e.g.: StudyInstanceUID or \
00100020. By default, all attributes from the DICOM file(s) will be included.
